I am a senior partner engineer at Google. I engage with top apps and games, and act 
as trusted advisor and technical expert. I specialize in Android technical quality
(ANRs, crashes and memory) and build (Gradle).

I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman 
University](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel.

Since 2005 I have been working with Android from Samsung to Varonis and now at Google.
