I am a senior partner engineer at Google. I engage with top apps and games companies, and act 
as a trusted advisor and a technical expert.

I am passionate about system optimizations: 
* Java - Gradle, multi-threading, JNI (C/C++)
* Android - ANRs, crashes, memory, thermals   

I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman 
University](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel.
