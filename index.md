I am an Android senior partner engineer at Google. I engage with top apps and games, and act 
as a trusted advisor and a technical expert.

I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman 
University](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel.

Since 2010 I have been working with Android starting from Samsung and Varonis then moved to Google.
