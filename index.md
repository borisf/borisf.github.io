I am a Senior Software Engineer with customer facing experience, working as a Partner Engineer at Google.

My career has span from developing Android automatic updates and file synchronization applications to desktop 
developer tools such as [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark)  and [Gradle Recipes](https://github.com/android/gradle-recipes), to the server side, Google Play Billing, Android Vitals and Play Multi Platform.

At Google I guide companies on Android low memory, build (AGP) and I/O (ANRs, network) optmizations.
 
I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman
