I am a Senior Software Engineer with Java and Linux experience, working as a Partner Engineer at Google. I enjoy the intersection
of technology, problem solving and people.

My career has span from developing Android apps and games to
developer tools, [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark) and [Gradle Recipes](https://github.com/android/gradle-recipes), 
to the server side, working on Google Play.

At Google, I guide companies on: 
* Google Play integrations - Billing, Multi Platform and Android Vitals.
* Android APIs and Linux internals - Android Build (AGP) and Memory optimizations.
 
I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman 
University](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel.
