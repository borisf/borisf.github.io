I am a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead working as a Partner Engineer at Google. I enjoy the intersection
of technology, problem solving and people.

My career has span from developing Android apps and games to desktop 
developer tools, [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark) and [Gradle Recipes](https://github.com/android/gradle-recipes), 
to the server side, working on Google Play.

At Google, I guide top partners on: 
* Play Game Services
* Java/Linux memory optimizations
 
I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman 
University](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel.
