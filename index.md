I am a senior partner engineer at Google. Our team engages with top apps and games.
We act as trusted advisors and technical experts on a wide array of Android topics.
I specialize in  technical quality (ANRs, crashes and memory) and build (Gradle).

I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from Reichmann 
university in Israel.

Since 2005 I have been working with Android from Samsung to Varonis and now at Google.
