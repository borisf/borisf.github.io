I am a Senior Software Engineer working as a Partner Engineer at Google. I guide top companies on 
[Google Play Games Services](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/overview) client-server integrations.
I enjoy the intersection of technology, problem solving and people.

To work effectively with frameworks such
as Spring and Android, I create small, focused programs that call framework abstracted (low level) APIs.
 
My expertise includes:  
* Backend - Spring, Spring Boot, SQL and AI  
* Java - Kotlin, [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), multi-threading and optimizations
* Linux - memory APIs and Bash
* Outreach - techical writing, mentoring and public speaking

I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman 
University](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel.
