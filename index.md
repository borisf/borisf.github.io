I am a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead working as a Partner Engineer at Google. I enjoy the intersection
of technology, problem solving and people.

I started from developing Android apps and games, moved to desktop 
developer tools, [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark) and [Gradle Recipes](https://github.com/android/gradle-recipes), 
and to the server side, working on [Google Play Game Services](https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/overview).
 
I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman 
University](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel.
