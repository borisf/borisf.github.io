I am a Senior Software Engineer with customer facing experience, working as a Partner Engineer at Google. I enjoy the intersection
of problems, technology and people.

My career has span from developing Android automatic updates and file synchronization applications to
developer tools, [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark) and [Gradle Recipes](https://github.com/android/gradle-recipes), 
to the server side, working on Google Play Billing (fraud) and Play Multi Platform (OAuth 2.0) integrations.

At Google, I guide companies on:
* Server - Google Play Billing and Play Multi Platform integrations.
* Android - low memory, build (AGP) and ANR optimizations.
 
I received my masters in Software Engineering and MBA in Marketing from [Reichman 
University](https://www.runi.ac.il/en/) in Israel.
